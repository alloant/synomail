1. use {% with notes = notes1 %} {% endwith %}

2. Different registers. Like Aes, vc, der or gul. That way you see your own registers.

3. Def in Note style contains(user) and then can see if it have to be seen or not.

4. Use flash() for the logging thing

6. To add and remove ref I put in the form a text line and people write like Aes 98/23... Then I check them and add them as proper refs. Or remove then.
